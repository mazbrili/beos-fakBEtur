List of ideas and mistakes
(own and based on post-competition reviews)
- the option of displaying gross prices (e.g. for the target price of 22% to be PLN 15)
- entering goods via a purchase invoice (?)
- too much discount warning - attempted to sell at a price lower than the purchase price
- better sorting (own)
- appearance: in the style of Be break the edition into new windows, and in the main only lists with full information about the document (what is on the left)
- input control: nrb, tax identification number, zip code, contractor's name (how?) - appropriate warnings
